# Stencil Redux Demo

This is a simple demo using Stencil with the [Stencil Redux](https://github.com/ionic-team/stencil-redux) collection.

Stencil Redux is a small library that uses the vanilla Redux library and automatically supplies state to props on components, as well as binding actions to the store's dispatch.

This example also follows a [Typed Redux Action Pattern](https://spin.atomicobject.com/2017/07/24/redux-action-pattern-typescript/) which we find adds some nice TypeScript benefits to using Redux.

See [Stencil Redux](https://github.com/ionic-team/stencil-redux) for more information on how that collection works.
